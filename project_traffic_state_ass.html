									<h2>Problem description</h2>
									<h3>Full paper: <a class="fa fa-book" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/1/144"></a> | Implementation: <a class="icon brands fa-github" href="#"></a></h3>
									
									<p class="article">
										An accurate derivation of fundamental traffic state variables is key for sophisticated traffic management. 
										Urban areas especially suffer from congestion due to a higher population density, traffic lights, and elevated 
										mobility demand. In addition, other variables, traffic flow information at specific locations in the network, 
										and travel times between an origin and a destination are of great importance for traffic operators. In particular, 
										travel times allow for the derivation of the network's current level of service (LoS) and influence the 
										network user's mode and route choice. Consequently, accurate sensor technology is needed to detect vehicles 
										traveling through a network with a low error rate where traffic variables satisfy accuracy requirements 
										[1]. However, urban areas are sometimes sparsely equipped with sensors, which negatively affects accuracy and 
										increases the noise level of the results. In addition, various sensor technologies used in urban environments
										are only suitable for deriving particular traffic variables and differ in data resolution. New technologies 
										such as video/thermal cameras and Bluetooth/WiFi sensors enable accurate derivation of traffic flow and 
										provide good results in measuring travel time since unique vehicle identification based on MAC address 
										recognition is possible. 
									</p>
									<p class="article">
										Although numerous studies have evaluated and estimated travel times on freeways and in urban areas [2,3,4], 
										only a few studies have compared emerging sensor technologies to empirical ground-truth measurement. In addition, the question remains of 
										how traditional sensor data can help with travel time estimation in terms of performance improvement. 
										Therefore, this work provides traffic state representation regarding traffic flow and travel time estimation 
										within an urban network. We run a multi-sensor campaign in Zurich, Switzerland, including video measurements
										from a particular area and investigate the time series derivation of travel times. Consequently, we 
										compare the following data sources: (a) thermal camera sensor data that are equipped with a WiFi 
										interface (b) processed video data with an automated license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm, 
										and (c) Google Distance Matrix data from the particular area. For comparative results, the video data 
										serves for the exact determination of traffic flow and travel times, i.e., a ground-truth data set. 
										Besides assessing the different data sets, we propose a simple yet efficient multiple linear regression 
										(MLR) model to estimate travel times in a future environment with connected and automated vehicles (CAV). 
										We create a baseline scenario with a random 5% sample of the ground-truth data that emulates data from 
										moving sensors (e.g., from CAVs). Finally, a model that fuses moving sensor data with traditional loop 
										detectors (LD) and traffic signal data is proposed. The estimation results are compared to the baseline 
										and ground-truth data.
									</p>
									<p class="article">
										As this study focuses on traffic state estimation via travel time derivation in an urban environment, 
										a small area is selected that reflects the quantities variance but does not allow for complex traffic 
										movements, e.g., a high number of possible routes. The particular area is located in Zurich, Switzerland, 
										in the northern part of the city. A four-leg intersection is selected, where three legs are observed 
										by the given set of sensors. Consequently, six routes are constructed and travel times from the different 
										data sources are determined. The travel time is denoted as <var>τ<sub>i</sub>(t)</var>, where the index i denotes the route. 
										Figure 1 shows the comparisons of the investigated data sources for route 1 and 5, i.e., <var>τ<sub>1</sub>(t)</var>,
										<var>τ<sub>5</sub>(t)</var>.
									</p>
									<p class="article">
										The travel time results are derived by determining the timestamp when a vehicle enters and exits the system. 
										As data sources (a) the WiFi module of the installed thermal cameras (in blue), (b) the detected license 
										plates from the ALPR algorithm (in orange) (c) tracked data from the Google Distance Matrix API (in green), 
										and (d) the empirical measurement, i.e., the ground-truth data set (in grey) are used.

									<p class="article">
										We derive all travel time data sets and calculate the 10 min weighted moving average (the window size k=10). 
										One can note that the quantity <var>τ<sub>i</sub>(t)</var> increases over time, peaks around 17:45, and decreases again afterward. 
										Results computed from the ALPR detections (orange time series) replicate this trend with small deviations. 
										The time series correlate with a Pearson correlation coefficient <var>ρ=0.99</var> and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error 
										(MAPE) <var>MAPE=3.14%</var>. Contrary results are shown by the set of thermal cameras’ WiFi modules that are utilized 
										for travel time derivation of τ_1 (t). The time series only shows small variations and does not capture the 
										trend of the ground-truth data  (<var>ρ=0.71;MAPE=58.07%</var>). Potential reasons for the modest performance can be 
										(a) a low penetration rate, i.e., a small number of WiFi devices are detected [5], or 
										(b) the data are strongly post-processed. The time series computed from the Google Distance Matrix API shows 
										a higher variance than the thermal camera data and fails to show the variation of the ground-truth data 
										(<var>ρ=0.27;MAPE=25.95%</var>). For the travel times on <var>r<sub>5</sub></var>, i.e., <var>τ<sub>5</sub>(t)</var>, the ALPR algorithm allows an accurate 
										representation of the ground-truth data with <var>ρ=0.99</var> and <var>MAPE=2.73%</var>. The thermal camera data shows a correlation 
										of <var>ρ=0.72</var> with an <var>MAPE=20.60%</var>, and the Google data allows the computation of <var>ρ=0.33</var> and <var>MAPE=45.49%</var>.
										To improve the travel times from data sources as shown above, a estimation methodology is designed that fuses (a) features set computed based 
										on LD data and (b) 5% data sample from Connected Automated Vehicles (CAV) (implemented by drawing a random sample from the ground-truth data). 
										Figure 2 shows results for the test data (30 minute period) and compares (a) the 5% sample, (b) the baseline model 
										(taking just the 5% sample as input) and (c) the final model that fuses the data sources against the ground-truth. 
										Results show that a 5% data sample is insufficient to represent the ground-truth travel time <var>τ<sub>3</sub>(t)</var>. 
										This is supported by a high <var>MAPE=18.10%</var>. The trained baseline model shows an <var>adjR<sup>2</sup></var> of 0.40 and over- 
										and underestimates the travel time in Figure 2. The predicted time series results in an <var>MAPE=11.62%</var>. 
										Nevertheless, it can be shown that our model already improves the estimation by 6.48%. Finally, we apply 
										the model with all features utilized as predictors. Although the model also indicates deviations from the 
										ground-truth data, the <var>adjR<sup>2</sup></var> equals 0.81, and the MAPE reduces further to 10.92%. This highlights that 
										the explainability of the final model doubled compared to the baseline model [6].
